Here I'll write down the specification for the menu I'm going to use at first
as a prototype just to see how things work. Only after that am I going to write
the proper one with the animations and everything.

[ ] In-real-time addition and removal of items.
[ ] Possible actions on the items of the layout: (some of these actions may interact with a database)
    [ ] "Done"
    [ ] "Postpone"
    [ ] "Delete"
