### Tasklist

  So there's still a lot to do, but currently these are roughly the things 
  that I'm trying to implement. The ones (mostly) completed will have an
  ' x ' in the checkbox

+ [ ]  Keybindings
+ [ ]  Terminal configuration
+ [ ]  Good colorscheme and overall consistent "theme"
+ [ ]  Titlebars
+ [ ]  Menubar
+ [ ]  Widgets
+ [ ]  Notifications
+ [ ]  Other trivial functionality through the 'alt' modifier
