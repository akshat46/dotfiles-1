### Tasklist

  So there's still a lot to do, but currently these are roughly the things 
  that I'm trying to implement. The ones (mostly) completed will have a
  ' x ' in the checkbox

    [x]  Keybindings
    [x]  Terminal configuration
    [x]  Good colorscheme and overall consistent "theme"
    [ ]  Titlebars
    [ ]  Menubar
    [ ]  Widgets
    [ ]  Notifications
    [ ]  Other trivial functionality through the 'alt' modifier
