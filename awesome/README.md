# My awesome window manager config

First off, this is very frail, not structured, there are still some bugs,
but it's pretty usable at this moment.
Until I actually get it done and I can clean things up, only the todo list
will be here

## TODO
    <!--- 
    i still want the widgets from the wibar, but I don't like the wibar
    that's why I'll have to implement the widgets in some other way,
    before I can take the wibar out completely
    EDIT: I'll first try to make it look good and then maybe I won't take it out
    -->
    [ ]  Removing the wibar
        [ ]  Taglist widget

    [ ]  Maybe (Things I'm not sure I'll implement)
        [ ] Write some sort of mpd frontend
        [ ] Write some sort of scheduling wiget
        [ ] Write some sort of settings widget
        [ ] Hotplugging: automatically mounting devices when they get plugged in
